Welcome to the Samanta Virtual Assistant project!

This project consists of:

- A **Python** backend (Python 3.12) for voice interactions including:
  - Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using `pyannote.audio`
  - Speech-to-Text (STT) using `whisperx`
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS) using options like Replicate Kokoro (or alternatives)
  - An LLM integration (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo or alternatives)
  - An interruption system to allow the user to stop the assistant
